			Currently, there are <b>six units</b> through which a student can select the subject after appearing in the admission exams. 
			These exams are quite competitive as the number of available seats are limited. 
			The department of Computer Science and Engineering in Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur, also known as CSE BRUR, is under Faculty of Engineering and Technology and the admission seeking students must appear in the <b>E unit</b> exam for admission. 
			There are <b>45</b> seats in CSE BRUR. The process of admission starts after the result of Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) or equivalent (in case of O/A level and International students) Examination of all education board. As part of that process, 
			the admission committee publishes circular for the admission on national newspapers and  University's official website.<br><br><br>
